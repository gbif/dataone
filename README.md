### DataONE MemberNode 

This is a project led by GBIF to help enable adopters to develop Java based DataONE Member Node stacks.

**This project depends on source code that is generated from schemas during build time**

To build the project run ```mvn package``` and ensure that the src/main/java-generated (dataone-api) is on your classpath in your IDE.


This multi-module project is structured as follows:
  1. dataone-api: Interfaces, schemas and a build that will generate JAXB classes from the schemas
  2. dataone-auth: Utilities to simplify handling of X509Certificates 
  3. dataone-membernode: The RESTful implementation built on Dropwizard* that can be extended with plugable backends
  4. dataone-membernode-hadoop: A runnable implementation that is backed by Hadoop technologies

    
>Dropwizard includes:
> - Jersey for REST
> - Yammer for Metrics
 
#### To build the project:

```
mvn package 
```

Once built, the next step would be to explore [the test configuration in the dataone-membernode](dataone-membernode/README.md) module.
